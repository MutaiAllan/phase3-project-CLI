## Moringa Phase 3 Project: CLI

## Learning Goals
1. Configure environments with project-specific parameters using Pipenv.
2. Import and use external libraries.
3. Use SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic to create a database schema and update it as you continue to build your CLI.
4. Use SQLAlchemy ORM to join multiple tables to each other using one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships.
5. Use one or more algorithm from DSA.
6. Exercise best practices in CLI design.

## Key Vocab
1. Command Line: a text-based interface that is built into your computer's operating system. It allows you to access the files and applications on your computer manually or through scripts.
2. Terminal: the application in Mac OS that allows you to access the command line.
3. Command Shell/Powershell: the applications in Windows that allow you to access the command line.
4. Command-Line Interface (CLI): a text-based interface used to run programs, manage files and interact with objects in memory. As the name suggests, it is run from the command line.
